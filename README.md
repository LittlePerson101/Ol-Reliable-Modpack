# Wait, so what is this?
Ol' Reliable is a Minecraft ModPack that I have been working on for some time. The aim of this project is to create a pack that is, reliable (I mean, it's kinda in the name). Ol' Reliable has many mods that are great utilities for those who enjoy a chill single-player experience. Or create havoc, it's up to you. Currently, I have this project in versions between 1.21.5 and 1.18.1-ish, but I am working on getting more versions out.

## So what does this thing have?
Great question, if you asked lol! This Modpack has a bunch of mods that are user-friendly to builders like: Litematica, Freecam, Iris, and WorldEdit. Also if you like quality-of-life features, I have that too! For example: Shulker Box Tooltip, Voice Chat, Fast IP Ping, Gamma/Fullbright, Dynamic FPS, and a bunch of other stuff! I know a lot of ppl are into PvP based packs, so I might sprinkle in some mods that help with that when I release v2.0 but it's up to you guys!

### So is it just Fabric?
Short Answer: Yep! BUT, I really wanna get a NeoForge version so be on the lookout for that
EDIT:
I have a beta NeoForge version for 1.21.4! Go check it out!

# Ok WAIT Before you download! Read this!
I have indeed heard about the controversy about the Essential Mod! This pack does have Essential! If you prefer not to use the mod for whatever reason: I DO NOT JUDGE! Then please be on the lookout for the Non-Essential version, it's still in the works tho so maybe in like a month! I'll link it in the desc. when I get it working!

## Having Issues? Or an idea for the pack!
Check out my GitHub repository and write in the issues tab! Even if it's not an issue! 

Also not related to the above BUT: This is'nt the most "Fair-Play Friendly" Modpack because of Xaero's Minimap and Freecam and such. So I am not responsible if you get banned off a server because of this pack, be sure to read the servers opinion on these mods before playing for the best experience!

Anyhow! That's it for now! Enjoy the Reliable Experience lol.
