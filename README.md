#Build Guide

Release Builds: If the version you download is a release build that means the build contains all mods, mods can be added without breaking the pack (depending on your mod), and minimal bugs should be found when using

Beta Builds: If the version you download is a beta build that means the build may not have all mods, bugs might be found, and it is recommended not to add mods unless necessary

Alpha Builds: If the version you download is an apha build that means the build will not have all mods, bugs are common, and if you add mods it will most likely break functionality of the pack
